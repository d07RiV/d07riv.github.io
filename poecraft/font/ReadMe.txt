                              Fontin TrueType


This is a new conversion of Jos Buivenga's "Fontin" typeface into TrueType
format for Windows.  In this version, the descenders are intact and the
line spacing is much closer to that of the Macintosh original.

If you have the earlier conversion into OpenType format, you should
uninstall it (drag the four Fontin-* files out of your Fonts folder)
before installing this version.


Technical trivia:  I did the conversion with George Williams's FontForge
v2006-10-25 20:02.  I have appended the string "(TrueType)" to the version
numbers to differentiate this conversion from the earlier OpenType
version.  In addition, I've changed the base font name of the smallcaps
version from "Fontin" to "Fontin SmallCaps" to prevent Windows from
confusing it with Fontin Regular.
